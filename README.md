### Hi there, I'm Sheena ðŸ‘‹

I'm an educator, software engineer, writer and creator of systems. I have a lot of niche knowledge at the intersection of tech and education. I want to power up tech educators by sharing what I know, and by learning in public.

I have a [blog](https://www.sheenaoc.com/). I aim to make it useful. 

You can follow me on the different social media platforms to see what I'm up to:
